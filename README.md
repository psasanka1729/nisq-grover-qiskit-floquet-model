# About
This code studies Grover's search algorithm with systematic noise by modelling it as a Floquet system. The decomposition used here is the one provided by Qiskit. My earlier research in https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10344v1 shows that the physics of the system depends on how we decompose or transpile the Grover operator in terms of single and two qubit gates. I started this as a side project on my own and it is incomplete.
